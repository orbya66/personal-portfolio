<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a high-end, multi-page portfolio website with an Iron Man HUD aesthetic.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Visual Theme:** Pure black background (#000000), glowing orange (#FF4D00) accents, minimalist, cinematic, industrial style with thin borders, grid overlays, and sharp edges.
-   **Pages:** Home, Work (The Vault), Skills (Technical Specs), Contact (Comms).
-   **Content & Functionality:**
    -   The entire website's content (projects, skills, text, colors) must be editable and customizable.
    -   A comprehensive Admin Panel is required to manage all dynamic content, including site configuration, colors, projects, and skills.
    -   The Work (The Vault) section must be a filterable gallery for video projects, handling various resolutions and auto-aligning perfectly. It should support hover-to-play video previews.
    -   The Skills (Tech Specs) section should auto-align and dynamically display skills grouped by category.
    -   The system must support uploading and storing media (thumbnails, videos) instead of relying on external URLs. Google Drive links should also be supported.
    -   A custom global cursor styled like an Iron Man Arc Reactor with a motion trail.
    -   Implement Glitch page transitions and Decode text animations.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend) with a MongoDB database. The Iron Man HUD aesthetic is implemented across Home, Work, Skills, and Contact pages. The site is highly dynamic, with most content and configuration managed via a comprehensive admin panel.

-   **Data Backend:** MongoDB is the primary data source for projects, skills, and site configuration. JSON files in  are used for seeding the database.
-   **Admin Panel ():** A password-protected page allows the user to manage:
    -   **Projects & Skills:** Full CRUD functionality.
    -   **Site Configuration:** Site name, owner, tagline, social links, etc.
    -   **Theme Colors:** Includes presets and custom color pickers that update the site's CSS variables.
-   **Dynamic Pages:** The Work and Skills pages fetch data from the backend and dynamically render content, including auto-generating filters and stats.
-   **Media Uploads:** The backend has endpoints () and a dedicated  directory. The admin UI includes buttons for file uploads, but the storage is not yet persistent.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was in the middle of a major bug-fixing session based on a detailed list of user complaints accompanied by screenshots. The agent had just overwritten  to address UI glitches and was preparing to fix the custom cursor's behavior over video iframes and other video playback issues.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? frontend testing agent
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Admin Panel UI is glitchy and has alignment issues, including white lines overlapping content. (PRIORITY: P0)
  - Issue 2: The custom arc-reactor cursor glitches out (gets stuck, disappears) when hovering over embedded video players (e.g., YouTube). (PRIORITY: P0)
  - Issue 3: The hover to play video feature on project cards in the Work page is not working. (PRIORITY: P1)
  - Issue 4: Videos linked from Google Drive are not playing correctly. (PRIORITY: P1)
  - Issue 5: The file upload system is not fully implemented. Uploaded files are not stored persistently. (PRIORITY: P1)
  - Issue 6: The category selection dropdown in the admin panel needs better UI/UX and animations. (PRIORITY: P2)
  
  **Issues Detail:**
  - **Issue 1: Admin Panel Glitches**
     - Attempted fixes: The agent overwrote  with a completely refactored version.
     - Next debug checklist:
       - Inspect the CSS in , specifically the  class which might be causing global style conflicts.
       - Isolate the Admin page from global styles that may be interfering.
     - Why fix this issue?: The admin panel is currently hard to use due to visual bugs.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue?: Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - **Issue 2: Cursor Glitch Over Videos**
     - Attempted fixes: None yet. The agent was about to start this fix.
     - Next debug checklist:
       - Edit .
       - Add logic to detect when the mouse is over an  or video element.
       - When over a video, hide the custom cursor and show the default system cursor to allow interaction with video controls.
     - Why fix this issue?: It's impossible to interact with embedded videos because the custom cursor element overlays them.
     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue?: N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:** These issues are all related to video playback, file storage, and admin panel UX.
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has rewritten  and parts of , but the functionality is still not working as per the user's report.
     - Next debug checklist:
       - **Hover Play:** Review  to ensure  and  events correctly trigger video play/pause.
       - **Google Drive:** Research the correct way to embed and autoplay Google Drive videos. It often requires a specific URL format ( instead of ).
       - **File Storage:** The current  directory is ephemeral. The backend upload endpoint in  needs to be modified to save files to a persistent volume or a third-party storage service.
       - **Category Dropdown:** Refactor the dropdown component in  using a library like  or by adding custom CSS animations for a better look and feel.
     - Why fix this issue?: Core functionality requested by the user is broken or incomplete.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue?: Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Both
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1: Comprehensive Bug Fixing and Optimization**
     - Where to resume: The agent has fixed the admin panel's  file but needs to address the remaining issues: cursor glitches, video playback (hover, Google Drive), persistent file storage, and admin UI improvements.
     - What will be achieved with this?: A stable, bug-free website that meets all user requirements and is ready for deployment.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Both
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Implement Glitch Page Transitions:** The original request for a glitch or system loading animation between pages is still pending. This can be implemented using CSS animations or a stable library like GSAP.
    -   **P1: Implement Decode Text Animations:** Add a decode or type-out entrance animation for text elements.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Refactor Admin Panel:** The  file is over 2000 lines. It should be broken down into smaller, manageable components (e.g., , , ).

**Completed work in this session**
-   **UI Enhancement:** Added decorative HUD elements, stats, and corner brackets to all pages to make them feel less empty.
-   **Data Migration:** Shifted the primary data source from JSON files to a MongoDB database. Created sync scripts to populate the DB.
-   **Dynamic Content:** Made the Skills and Work pages fully dynamic, fetching data from MongoDB and auto-generating category filters and statistics.
-   **Admin Panel Creation:** Built a comprehensive, password-protected admin panel from scratch to manage projects, skills, site configuration, and theme colors.
-   **Media Upload Foundation:** Created backend endpoints and an  directory for file management.
-   **Bug Fixes:**
    -   Resolved a data-loading issue on the Skills page by syncing the JSON data to MongoDB.
    -   Fixed the custom cursor's alignment (misaligned triangles).
    -   Fixed initial alignment and glitch issues in the admin panel.
    -   Implemented a functional category dropdown in the admin project editor.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - The original animation requirements (glitch page transitions, decode text effects) were abandoned to fix a build-breaking bug with  and have not been re-implemented with a stable alternative.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue:** UI glitches and alignment problems in the admin panel.
  - **Recurrence count:** 2. The agent fixed initial alignment problems, but new ones (overlapping white lines) were reported by the user. This suggests a fragile CSS setup.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS Variables (for theming).
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python).
-   **Database:** MongoDB is the primary data source.
-   **Animations:** Custom CSS for HUD elements and cursor trail. JavaScript for cursor logic.

**key DB schema**
-   **projects:** 
-   **skills:** 
-   **config:** 

**changes in tech stack**
-   The data backend has been migrated from flat JSON files to **MongoDB**. The JSON files are now only used for seeding the database.

**All files of reference**
-   : Key file for the current bug-fixing task. It's very large and controls all admin functionality.
-   : Needs to be edited to fix cursor glitches over videos.
-   : Controls hover-to-play video functionality.
-   : Contains all API logic, including the incomplete file upload endpoint.
-   : Contains global styles and CSS variables that might be causing UI glitches in the admin panel.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **:** This is a monolithic 2000+ line component that urgently needs to be broken down into smaller, single-responsibility components (e.g., , , , ).
-   **Video Playback Logic:** The logic for playing videos is scattered across , , and . It could be centralized in a reusable  modal component.

**key api endpoints**
-   , , : Fetch data.
-   : GET/POST for site configuration.
-   , : Full CRUD endpoints.
-   : POST endpoint for file uploads.
-   : GET endpoint to list uploaded files.
-   , : Syncs JSON data to MongoDB.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **MongoDB is the source of truth.** Do not edit the JSON files in  expecting to see changes on the live site. Use the admin panel or direct database updates.
-   The  file is extremely fragile and complex. Be cautious when editing it. The best long-term solution is to refactor it into smaller components.
-   The user is highly focused on visual perfection. UI glitches, alignment issues, and animation problems are considered high-priority bugs.
-   The file upload feature is incomplete. It accepts files but doesn't store them in a persistent way. This needs to be a key area of focus.
