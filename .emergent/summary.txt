**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A functional multi-page portfolio website built with React and FastAPI. The Iron Man HUD aesthetic is implemented with a black background and glowing orange accents.

-   **Pages:** Home, Work, Skills, and Contact pages are created with React Router for navigation.
-   **Dynamic Content:** The Work (The Vault) and Skills (Tech Specs) pages fetch their content from a JSON-file-based backend via FastAPI endpoints, allowing the user to add new projects and skills without changing the code.
-   **Custom Cursor:** A custom cursor styled as a triangular Iron Man arc reactor with a smooth, fading motion trail has been implemented.
-   **Home Page:** Features a Mission Briefing section that displays a random project and a daily quote, both fetched from the backend. The layout has been centered.
-   **Logo:** The user's logo has been integrated into the sticky navigation header.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI server provides endpoints to serve project data, skills data, quotes, a contact form submission, and a resume download.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was addressing two issues raised by the user, who provided screenshots for clarity.
        1.  Removing a moving line artifact from the project cards on the Work page.
        2.  Removing the hero video container from the Home page and ensuring all content is properly centered.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: A moving scanline appears on the project cards in The Vault (Work page). (PRIORITY: P0)
  - Issue 2: The Home page needs to have its hero video container removed, and the content must be perfectly centered. (PRIORITY: P0)
  
  **Issues Detail:**
  - **Issue 1:**
     - Attempted fixes: The same  animation was previously removed from the Home page background. The user has now spotted it on the project cards.
     - Next debug checklist:
       - View the file .
       - Identify and remove the CSS class or element responsible for the  animation, likely applied to one of the  wrappers.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will remove a distracting and out-of-place visual artifact, creating a cleaner UI as requested by the user.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue?: Y (A similar issue was fixed on the Home page).
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - **Issue 2:**
     - Attempted fixes: The agent previously centered the home page content, but the user wants the video container removed entirely and the layout adjusted accordingly.
     - Next debug checklist:
       - Edit .
       - Remove the JSX element that acts as the container for the hero video.
       - Adjust the main container's flexbox or grid properties to ensure all remaining content (title, mission statement, buttons) is vertically and horizontally centered in the viewport.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will simplify the home page design to the user's new specification, focusing on the core text content.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue?: N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  There are no in-progress tasks; the current work is issue-driven.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
  - **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P1: Implement Glitch Page Transitions:** The original request for a glitch or system loading animation between pages was dropped due to technical issues with . This needs to be re-implemented using a stable method (e.g., pure CSS animations, or another library like GSAP).
    - **P1: Implement Decode Text Animations:** The request for text to have a decode or type-out entrance animation is still pending. This can be implemented using JavaScript and CSS.
    - **P2: Enable Video Playback:** The project cards in The Vault have a play icon, but clicking them does not do anything. Functionality should be added to open a modal and play the associated project video.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Initial Setup:** Created the full-stack application structure with React, FastAPI, and page routing.
- **Styling and Layout:** Implemented the core Iron Man HUD aesthetic with a black/orange color scheme and custom CSS.
- **Custom Cursor:** Designed and iterated on a custom arc reactor cursor with a motion trail, fixing sync, design, glow, and fade-out issues.
- **Dynamic Content (Projects):** Built a backend system () and updated the frontend () to allow adding unlimited projects via a  file.
- **Dynamic Content (Skills):** Built a backend system () and updated the frontend () to allow adding unlimited skills via a  file.
- **Home Page Features:** Added a Mission Briefing section with a random featured project and a Quote of the Day fetched from the backend.
- **Logo Integration:** Added the user's custom logo to the navigation header.
- **Major Bug Fix:** Resolved a critical and persistent Babel/webpack compilation error by systematically removing  and refactoring the  component into a simple CSS class.
- **Layout Refinement:** Centered content on the home page as per user feedback.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - The original, more complex animation requirements (page transitions, text decoding) that relied on  were removed to fix a build-breaking bug. They have not been replaced with an alternative solution yet.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue:** A  animation effect.
  - **Recurrence count:** 1. It was first removed from the Home page background and has now been reported on the Project cards.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS. The agent needs to remove it from .

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS (for animations, layout, and styling), JavaScript (for cursor effects).
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python).
-   **Data Storage:** Flat JSON files (, , ) are used as a simple database, accessed via backend API endpoints.
-   **Animations:** Primarily handled via custom CSS keyframe animations and JavaScript for the cursor trail.

**key DB schema**
No formal database is in use. Data is stored in JSON files with the following structures:

-   : 
-   : 
-   : 

**changes in tech stack**
-    was installed but subsequently removed from all components due to a recurring, unresolvable Babel compilation error within the build environment. Animations were reimplemented with standard CSS.

**All files of reference**
-   : Needs to be edited to remove the video container and re-center content.
-   : Needs to be edited to remove the moving scanline artifact.
-   : Contains the logic and styling for the custom cursor.
-   : Fetches and displays projects from the API.
-   : Fetches and displays skills from the API.
-   : Contains all API endpoints for fetching data and handling form submissions.
-   : Directory containing all editable JSON data files.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The animation system is a prime candidate for refactoring. The original goals for page transitions and text effects are not met. A decision should be made whether to carefully re-introduce a library like  or , or to build out more complex effects with pure CSS/JS.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Fetches all projects.
-   : Adds a new project.
-   : Fetches all skills.
-   : Adds a new skill.
-   : Fetches a random quote.
-   : Submits the contact form (currently logs to console).
-   : Serves the resume file for download.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   A major, persistent bug was a Babel compilation error () that was triggered by the  library and complex JSX components (). The issue was only resolved by completely removing  and simplifying components to use basic JSX with CSS classes for styling. Be extremely cautious if re-introducing animation libraries or complex component structures.
-   The backend is not using a database; it's reading and writing to JSON files in the  directory.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Remove the video from page one and center everything. Also, remove a moving line from the project cards (provided images). (PENDING)
2.  **User:** The mouse trail disappears suddenly, it should fade smoothly.
3.  **User:** Change the Latest Work title on the home page to an Ironman term.
4.  **User:** The cursor trail needs to fade away when idle. The home page should have a highlights feature with a random video and a quote.
5.  **User:** Make the Tech Specs page customizable.
6.  **User:** There's a triangle in The Vault and the mouse trail isn't visible enough/long enough.
7.  **User:** Uploaded a new logo.
8.  **User:** Uploaded the first logo.
9.  **User:** Make it possible to add unlimited videos to The Vault.
10. **User:** The glow on the cursor is too much.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working:** Core site structure, navigation, dynamic content for projects/skills, custom cursor, contact form, resume download.
-   **Broken:** Nothing is critically broken, but the user has requested two final layout/style fixes.
-   **Mocked:** The animation system is a simplified version of the original request. The backend for the contact form just logs data instead of sending an email.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   : Used for icons (e.g., the play button triangle on project cards).

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: N/A
  - Test files created: None.
  - Known regressions: The  animation, which was fixed in one place, has appeared in another.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent successfully debugged a major issue by removing , but it did not circle back to implement the user's original animation requests (page transitions, text decode effects) using an alternative, stable method.</analysis>
